          It's simple logic, you get out of a learning experience what you put into it. By taking the time to think through what you want to learn and planning a project that matches your learning goals, you can can be more certain to get what you need out of your mentor sessions. Not to mention the fact that thinking through your learning goals and making a plan means having much more successful and productive mentoring sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, it is essential for mentees to take ownership of their own learning, in part because it's not fair to expect mentors to come prepared with lesson plans and teaching strategies, but also because it's the only way to be sure you are learning exactly what you need and want.

          There are so many generous developers out there who want to give back to the community but don't have a ton of time and/or they canâ€™t make a long-term commitment to a mentee. 
        <p>
          There are just as many hard working aspiring coders out there hacking away at things on their own and making slow progress. Sometimes, all it takes is a kind and patient mentor great to help you get unstuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          This program is designed to take everyone's busy life with all its schedule changes  &amp; shifting interests and priorities into account. Mentors can share their time, talents,  &amp; skills in truly meaningful  &amp; productive ways in just three one-hour mentoring sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>This doesn't mean you can't keep working with the amazingly awesome mentor or mentee you just met!</strong> It just means that you're doing your own thing, outside of this program after three meetings - which is totally rad, we just can't organize all that right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mentors, once you have completed your sessions, your committment is fulfilled and you can decide to sign up again if you want keep helping/learning by finding a new mentee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mentees, once you finish your sessions, you can keep hacking on your own or just write up a new request and connect with a new mentor for the next leg of your journey.</p>
