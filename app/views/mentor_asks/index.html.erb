    <h1>How it works ..</h1>
    <p class="lead">Hey Mentors! This program is designed to take your
      busy life with all its schedule changes, shifting interests, and
      priorities into account. You can share your time, talents, and skills
      in truly meaningful and productive ways in just three one-hour
      mentoring sessions. We are here to help make it easy and rewarding to
      help others to learn how to code well. Here is how:
    </p> 
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Finding the right person to mentor</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The table of mentor requests below allows you to find someone
            interested in learning the skills you know and are interested in
            teaching.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you find an interesting request, you can check to
            see when and where they can meet with you. You can also filter the
            table to only show requests that fit your interests and availability
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you find the right person and sign up to be their mentor, we
            will send both of you an email to help introduce you to each other.
            You are then ready to get in touch and schedule your first meeting.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Preparing for your mentoring session</h4>
