We would like to introduce you to your mentor. Their name is
<%= @mentor.name %> and you can contact them at <%= @mentor.email %>.

Please take a moment to read over the Process Guidelines and Code of Conduct
before beginning your sessions. We ask that you abide by these guidelines for
the good of everyone involved.

You can find the full document here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AgAqj82sUnD3QzRwLmNBNLPuHqz0jzjWY8Mls9o98Gw/edit?usp=sharing

We recommend you schedule your three sessions right away. You will both
receive an email with a google eval form in about 3 weeks asking for feedback
about how things are going.   

Please feel free to email Erica at mentors@hatsnpants.com if you have any
questions or concerns at any time.

Have fun!
